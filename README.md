Simple float management web application without Google Maps


Centi is a simple application for float managament. It relies in a MySQL database to get geolocation from devices. It features a map where you can track your devices, and a web service where devices can call to update position.

Centi's main feature is it's ability to show devices positions without the need for a Google Maps V3 licence. Centi uses Leftlet and your favorite OpenStreetMaps provider to show devices on map.

As stated for the licence, you can use this app as an starting point to build your own float management service.
